"""
PolishedWorld barter hardening layer.

Thin subclasses over Evennia's barter contrib that fix confirmed upstream
bugs WITHOUT forking the contrib's ~95-line command logic. We reuse the
contrib's CmdTrade.func unchanged and only swap in corrected helper classes
by reassigning the module globals that func resolves at call time.

CmdTrade is re-exported here so that routing the cmdset import through this
module is what loads it (and runs the monkeypatch) at server start.

Task 2.1: MongooseTradeTimeout
    Upstream TradeTimeout reads ndb.tradeevent, which is never assigned
    anywhere (the handler is stored as ndb.tradehandler). Result: a timed-out
    invite is never cleaned up and the inviter is left in a phantom trade.
